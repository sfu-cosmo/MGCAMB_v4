## 1. Introduction
Modified Growth with CAMB (MGCAMB) is a patch for the Einstein Boltzmann solver [CAMB](https://github.com/cmbant/CAMB) that intrdouces phenomenological Modifications of Growth (MG) along with dynamical Dark Energy (DE). It includes several phenomenological parametrizations. For instance:

- the mu, gamma parametrization, defined as

</p>

- the mu, Sigma parametrization, defined as
<p align="center">
<img src="img/mu_sigma.png" width="350" title="mu sigma parametrization" />
</p>

- the Q,R parametrization, defined as
<p align="center">
<img src="img/q_r.png" width="350" title="Q R parametrization" />
</p>

MGCAMB is implemented in the latest version of [CosmoMC](https://github.com/cmbant/CosmoMC) and can be used with [Cobaya](https://cobaya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The [MGCosmoMC](https://github.com/sfu-cosmo/MGCosmoMC) and [MGCobaya](https://github.com/sfu-cosmo/MGCobaya) codes are also available for download. 

### Structure of the code
The new MGCAMB patch is structured as in the figure.

<p align="center">
<img src="img/MGCAMB_flowchart.png" width="1000" title="MGCAMB code structure" />
</p>

The parameters in  [``` params_MG.ini ``` ](inifiles/params_MG.ini) are used to run the code and follow the structure above. Please note that dynamical DE is supported in the ``` pure_MG_models ```, where DE perturbations could also be included, and ``` cubic-spline model ```.

## 2. How to install
To install MGCAMB on your machine, simply run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sfu-cosmo/MGCAMB_v4.git
cd MGCAMB_v4/fortran/
make 
```

## 3. How to run
To run MGCAMB, first modify the  [``` params_MG.ini ``` ](inifiles/params_MG.ini) file according to which models you want to use. Then run

```bash
./camb ../inifiles/params.ini
```



## 4. What's new
New features with this new version of the code:
- implemented the QSA models where only dark matter is coupled to scalar field
- added background model based on parameterization of the DE density Omega_x, as opposed to w
- implemented a non-parametric reconstruction of mu, Sigma and Omega_x based on cubic-spline interpolation
- implemented the direct mu, Sigma parametrization for different models
- the option of including DE perturbations to achieve the consistency with CAMB when working with $w \neq âˆ’1$ background models. (controlled by parameter `MGDE_pert`)
- added a python wrapper to run MGCAMB from the python interface\
  (make sure to use function ``` set_mgparams ``` alongside other functions e.g. ``` set_cosmology ``` or ``` set_params ``` in your script.)
- the code has been restructured and upgraded to CAMB version 1.3.5 
- added compatibility with Cobaya [(MGCobaya)](https://github.com/sfu-cosmo/MGCobaya)
  
The MG and DE parametrizations along with the computation of the quantities related to the perturbations are introduced in the file [``` mgcamb.f90 ```](fortran/mgcamb.f90).

## 5. Known issues
- The debug mode (`make Debug`) is not well-tested for this version. Please run the code using the normal option described in sections [2](#2-how-to-install) and [3](#3-how-to-install) .
- (**Fixed**) The setting of Dark energy interface and the reading issue of X_arr for `DE_model == 3` in Fortran core. Thanks to Kushal Lodha. 
- The model of effective Newton's constant (``mugamma_par = 3``) is not fully developed.
