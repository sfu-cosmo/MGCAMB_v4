## 1. Introduction
Modified Growth with CAMB (MGCAMB) is a patch for the Einstein Boltzmann solver [CAMB](https://github.com/cmbant/CAMB) that intrdouces phenomenological Modifications of Growth (MG) along with dynamical Dark Energy (DE). It includes several phenomenological parametrizations. For instance:

- the mu, gamma parametrization, defined as

</p>

- the mu, Sigma parametrization, defined as

<img src="img/mu_sigma.png" width="350" title="mu sigma parametrization" />
</p>

- the Q,R parametrization, defined as

</p>

MGCAMB is implemented in the latest version of [CosmoMC](https://github.com/cmbant/CosmoMC). The MGCosmoMC code can be found in this [repository](https://github.com/sfu-cosmo/MGCosmoMC).

### Structure of the code
The new MGCAMB patch is structured as in the figure.

<p align="center">

</p>

The parameters in  [``` params_MG.ini ``` ](inifiles/params_MG.ini) are used to run the code and follow the structure above. 
Please, note that dynamical DE is supported in the ``` pure_MG_models ```, where DE perturbations could also be included, and ``` cubic-spline model ```.

as well as the original CAMB [paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9911177).

## 2. How to install
To install MGCAMB on your machine, simply run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sfu-cosmo/MGCAMB.git
cd MGCAMB/fortran/
make 
```

## 3. How to run
To run MGCAMB, first modify the  [``` params_MG.ini ``` ](inifiles/params_MG.ini) file according to which models you want to use. Then run

```bash
./camb ../inifiles/params.ini
```



## 4. What's new
New features with this new version of the code:
- implemented the QSA models where only dark matter is coupled to scalar field
- added background model based on parameterization of the DE density Omega_x, as opposed to w
- implemented a non-parametric reconstruction of mu, Sigma and Omega_x based on cubic-spline interpolation
- implemented the direct mu, Sigma parametrization for different models
- the option of including DE perturbations to achieve the consistency with CAMB when working with $w \neq −1$ background models.
- added a python wrapper to run MGCAMB from the python interface\
  (make sure to use function ``` set_mgparams ``` alongside other functions e.g. ``` set_cosmology ``` or ``` set_params ``` in your script.)
- the code has been restructured and upgraded to CAMB version 1.3.5 
- added compatibility with Cobaya [(MGCobaya)](https://github.com/sfu-cosmo/MGCobaya-beta)

The MG and DE parametrizations along with the computation of the quantities related to the perturbations are introduced in the file [``` mgcamb.f90 ```](fortran/mgcamb.f90).
